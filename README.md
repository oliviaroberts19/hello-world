I am a recent graduate from Codergirl Data Analysis Cohort @ Lauchcode. For the past 18 years I have worked in public education.  I've served as a Classroom Teacher, Assistant Principal, Principal, Early Childhood Coordinator, Data Coach, Reading Interventionist in the Saint Louis Public Schools. Currently, I serve as a Supplemental Reading/Math Teacher in the Riverview Gardens School District. I am looking to utilize my skills and knowledge acquired in the Codergirl Program to transition into the field of Data Analysis.
